Student Study Service Program activities are done by students in groups consisting of students from different study program backgrounds to ensure their different knowledge can complement each other. Each group of the Student Study Service Program is supervised by a lecturer in charge. At the end of the program, each group makes a report about the result of their Student Study Service Program and a scientific article that will be submitted to a relevant journals to add to UPI scientific publications.

To ensure the effectiveness of the program, students who take the Internship program are not allowed to take any other courses for the semester. At the end of the program, each student will have an exam for the Internship Program by teaching in front of students in the classroom. The internship Program report also needs to be submitted by the students individually. Both exams and reports are assessed by the teacher in charge and the lecturer.

      "main_content": "Assessment is designed to measure the level of student’s achievement based on the learning process and the results against predetermined targets. An assessment is usually arranged in such a way to include all the expected learning achievement targets associated with one or a number of competencies covering the aspects of knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes.\n\nThe computer science education study programs of FPMIPA UPI use the multi-component assessment concept in its assessment process to measure the successful course achievement implementation level and the students final results achievement. The knowledge aspect is measured using a written exam; aspects of skills are measured using project tasks, performance, and/or presentations; and the attitude aspect is measured using peer assessment which is carried out in the activities of project assignments, work performance, and/or presentations. Based on the 2020 UPI Education Implementation Guidelines, the assessment of the student learning process is conducted at least twice in one semester, i.e. Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and the Final Semester Examination (UAS).\n\nBased on UPI Education Implementation Guidelines of 2020, 1 semester consists of 16 sessions with 14 sessions used for lectures, 1 session for the Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and 1 session for the Final-Semester Examination (UAS). In general, the Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) is administered on the 8th session and the Final-Semester Examination (UAS) on the 16th meeting. The students can take the Final-Semester Examination (UAS) if they have attended at least 80% of the sessions in a particular course. The administration of Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) is left to the lecturer of the course and the course schedule. The administration of the Final-Semester Examination (UAS), remedial teaching, and entry of grades is regulated by the Rector through the Vice Rector for Education and Student Affairs.\n\nMid-Semester Examination (UTS) and Final-Semester Examination (UAS) are organized according to the course categories, namely General Courses (MKU) and Core Expertise Competency Courses (MKIPS and MKPPS)...\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, tests are administered online using the (http://spot.upi.edu), SPADA (http://spada.upi.edu) and other applications/platforms such as https://quizizz.com, https://safeexambrowser.org which can be accessed from anywhere without the students having to come to campus.\n\nStudents who for some reason cannot take Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and/or Final-Semester Examination (UAS) must inform the lecturer prior to the exam time and submit supporting documentary evidence for their absence. Students will only be given the opportunity to take a make up examination if their absence is caused by: (a) an illness (proven by a doctor's certificate); (b) performing a task of representing the university in intra-curricular or extra-curricular activities outside campus; or (c) other legitimate and permissible reasons. Make up examinations are administered and scheduled by the lecturer in agreement with the student.. Assessment is carried out objectively and transparently, and in accordance with the regulation and procedures, and the results are informed to the students. Results are announced to provide feedback to the students on what they have done and achieved and to enourage those who have not made optimal efforts to improve themselves and obtain the better results in the future. Students who have not met the course passing criteria will receive a short-term treatment of remedial teaching and their have their semester learning plan (RPS) evaluated learning process improvement. Students who get an E (fail) in a course must sign up for the course again in the following semester. The grade to be assigned to the students is the final grade they will receive in the current semester. This is stated in the 2020 UPI Education Implementation Guidelines. The Internship Program (PPLSP) is a field program that introduces education study program students to the education/school environment, insights into the practice of learning observation, and the practice of implementing the teaching and learning process. This program aims to guide prospective teacher students in integrating their knowledge and skills into their future careers. The Internship Program (PPLSP) assessment components are regulated in the PPLSP manual. The Internship Program (PPLSP) participant students can take part in a practical teaching exam (PPLSP) if they have met t all the requirements - as regulated in the internship manual, including having practiced teaching for 16 meetings and other academic activities under the guidance of the tutor teacher and supervising lecturer. The Internship Program (PPLSP) exam assessment component includes individual reports - which contain the reports of The Internship Program (PPLSP) activities for 16 meetings, and the assessment of teaching practice exam that are by three assessors, namely the tutor teacher, the principal, and the supervising lecturer. The minimum passing grade for Internship Program (PLSP) is B. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the teaching examination and assessment activities are conducted online using Google form (available at https://bit.ly/penilaianpplspdosen page. In addition to the Internship Program (PPLSP), the students also learn about the wider community environment through the Student Community Service (KKN)whose implementation is coordinated by the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM). The students can download information related to the Student Community Service (KKN) on the http://kkn.lppm.upi.edu/ page. In the Student Community Service (KKN) students groups from various disciplinary backgrounds stay for a certain period of time in a community and participate actively in the life of the community. The group is guided by a supervising lecturer who serves as a companion and assessor for the student field activities. Before the Student Community Service (KKN) activities began, the lecturers and students would respectively be given briefing by the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM). Briefing for the supervisors relates to monitoring activities and information about the Student Community Service (KKN) assessments. Briefing for the students relates to the technical implementation of the Student Community Service (KKN) on the ground and the best practices. The supervising lecturer is responsible for monitoring activities. The assessment of the Student Community Service (KKN) participants is conducted on two aspects, namely the individual aspect and the group aspect. The supervising lecturer reports the KKN students score to the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM) for further entry into the system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UPI made some adjustment to the theme to allow participants (students) to continue to participate in activities risking their health health and safety. There are two tracks for completion of undergraduate (S1) study, namely the thesis track and the non-thesis track. The non-thesis track is for students who have a GPA (IPK) of 2.00 - 2.50. They are required to take 6 credits (SKS) of courses and make a thesis substitute paper. The study program makes regulations andSOPs for completion of study without a thesis track. The hesis track can be taken by students who have passed the thesis prerequisite courses, obtaining a minimum 105 credits (SKS) and GPA (IPK) of at least 2.50, and have received recommendation from the academic supervisor lecturer. The procedures for thesis writing are as follows: thesis coordinator assigns supervisors I and II to the students; the students are guided in writing a thesis proposal; students take the thesis proposal examination. If the proposal approved by the examiners, students can continue the guidance process with the two supervisors, such as conducting activities to develop the instruments and collect data; proceed with writing the report of the data collection results, discussion, and conclusion. If the thesis writing results are considered appropriate by the supervisors, the student can take the thesis defense. The proposal writing and examination,exam follows the SOP; the procedure for the thesis defense follows the SOP. The final score of the thesis includes the assessment of thesis writing and thesis defense examination. A student is said to have passed the thesis examination if his final-thesis score is at least 2.0 (on the scale of 4). The thesis research is carried out independently under the guidance of the two thesis supervisors. In general, the procedure for final completion of the study through the thesis track is presented in the following flowchart below. The assessment system in four study programs includes student learning processes and outcomes. This system includes formative and summative assessments. Formative assessment aims to obtain information that can be used to improve the learning process (program delivery), while summative assessment is used to assess the achievement of student learning outcomes (learning outcomes). The assessment guidelines generally follow the UPI Education Implementation Guidelines which can be accessed at http://www3.upi.edu/main/file/akademik/ea9ce-pedoman-penyelenggaraan-pendidikan-upi-tahun-2019.pdf. Principle of Benchmarking Assessment (PAP) is used to assess student’s performance in a course. With PAP student achievement of a goal/competency is assessed against predetermined criteria . The final grade of a course is the cumulative result of the components of the assignment, mid-semester exams, final-semester exams, and other assessment components. In practice, each course has its own assessment procedures and techniques appropriate to its characteristics as long as it is not in conflict with the provisions of UPI Education Implementation Guidelines. This practical assessment guideline is contained in the course syllabus/RPS developed by a lecturer. In general, each subject uses integrative assessment techniques, namely between the process and the results, and between other assessment components: attendance, quizzes, mid-semester exams (UTS), final-semester exams (UAS), assignments, practicum (if any), participation, and presentation (if any). The percentage of the assessment components include the element of attendance (5%); participation/quizzes/assignments/presentations (15%); practicum (10%); mid-semester exam (35%); and final-semester exams (35%). Table below is the illustrates guidelines for determining grades for each course. In compulsory courses, the minimum passing grade is C, while for elective courses the minimum passing grade is D. Students who get an E (fail), should retake the class in the following year in order to get the appropriate grade with pass criteria. Students cannot cancel the grades of courses that they have passed, unless the they transfer to a different department/study program, where they have to cancel the expertise courses of the previous study program, or in the case where a student sign up for more than the maximum study load specified in the curriculum structure. The achievement of the course learning outcome (CLO) can be seen from the student learning outcomes in these courses which are measured using summative test instruments. Each test instrument consists of a number of questions, each of which measures the CLO in that course. Each question that will be used for the exam is validated first by the head of the KBK where the subject is located. Parallel course (the same course taught in different classes) must use the same questions and assessment criteria. The final course outcomes are then evaluated by the GKM team to ensure the achievement of PLOs related to these courses. The results of the assessment in the form of the final grade must be inputted by the lecturer of the course into the lecturer score input system through the website https://siak.upi.edu/sinndo. If the lecturer is late in inputting the grades, the lecturer in question will receive a warning and consequences. Students can view the final grade information for the courses they contact through the website https://student.upi.edu. Lecturers are obliged to design, manage, provide assignments/exams, provide feedback, and maintain student academic documents in an orderly manner. Relevant tothis obligation, students have the right to obtain clear and transparent information about their study results in the form of test scores, quizzes, assignments or projects, practicum, and/or presentations. Students who have questions about their grades can directly contact the lecturer to discuss the problem. If there is an error in the process of inputting the grades, the lecturer can correct the grade to match the facts as long as it is still within the period of grade entry. If input error is detected after the grade entry period is over, the lecturer can submit a request letter to the UPI Academic Directorate to correct the grade. The relationship between the learning outcome, the learning strategy, and the assessment used to measure the learning outcome in computer science education study program will be presented below. Table below, illustrates the relationship between PLO, learning strategies and assessment in Computer Science Education Study Program.",
