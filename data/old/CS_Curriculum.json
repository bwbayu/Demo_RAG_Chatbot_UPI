For Student Study Service Program, students apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in their studies in the community, whileat the same time receive practical skills and new knowledge relevant to the theoretical knowledge they have learned . Student Study Service Program activities are done by students in groups consisting of students from different study program background to ensure theirdifferentknowledge can complement each other. Each group of Student Study Service Program is supervised by a lecturer in charge. An the end of the program, each group makes a report about the result of their Student Study Service Program and a scientific article that will be submitted to relevant journal to add to UPI scientific publications. Both are the basics things students need to do besides their individualand in group activities to receive their final score for Student Study Service Program.",

    "Examination": {
      "description": "Assessment is designed to measure the level of student’s achievement based on the learning process and the results against predetermined targets. An assessment is usually arranged in such a way to include all the expected learning achievement targets associated with one or a number of competencies covering the aspects of knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes.\n\nThe Computer Science study programs of FPMIPA UPI use the multi-component assessment concept in its assessment process to measure the successful course achievement implementation level and the students final results achievement. The knowledge aspect is measured using a written exam; aspects of skills are measured using project tasks, performance, and/or presentations; and the attitude aspect is measured using peer assessment which is carried out in the activities of project assignments, work performance, and/or presentations. Based on the 2020 UPI Education Implementation Guidelines, the assessment of the student learning process is conducted at least twice in one semester, i.e. Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and the Final Semester Examination (UAS).\n\nBased on UPI Education Implementation Guidelines of 2020, 1 semester consists of 16 sessions with 14 sessions used for lectures, 1 session for the Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and 1 session for the Final-Semester Examination (UAS). In general, the Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) is administered on the 8th session and the Final-Semester Examination (UAS) on the 16th meeting. The students can take the Final-Semester Examination (UAS) if they have attended at least 80% of the sessions in a particular course. The administration of Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) is left to the lecturer of the course and the cource schedule. The administration of the Final-Semester Examination (UAS), remedial teaching, and entry of grades is regulated by the Rector through he Vice Rector for Education and Student Affairs.\n\nMid-Semester Examination (UTS) and Final-Semester Examination (UAS) are organized according to the course categories, namely General Courses (MKU) and Core Expertise Competency Courses (MKIPS and MKPPS). This categorization is designed to help students take the exam in an orderly manner according to the specified time. The General Courses (MKU) exams are administered through a computer based test (CBT) by the General Courses (MKU) Study Program. The Core Expertise Competency Courses (MKIPS and MKKPS) examinations are conducted by the respective study programs. Examination schedules of the Core Competencey Courses are prepared by the study program and published offline or online on UPI Academics. The examination schedules are prepared by considering the time and student’s load. Only a maximum of two examinations are scheduled per day per class.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, tests are aministered online using the (http://spot.upi.edu), SPADA (http://spada.upi.edu) and other applications/platforms such as https://quizizz.com, https://safeexambrowser.org which can be accessed from anywhere without the students having to to come to campus.\n\nStudents who for some reason cannot take Mid-Semester Examination (UTS) and/or Final-Semester Examination (UAS) must inform the lecturer prior to the exam time and submit supporting documentary evidence for their absence. Students will only be given the opportunity to take a make up examination if their absence is caused by: (a) an illness (proven by a doctor's certificate); (b) performing a task of representing the university in intra-curricular or extra-curricular activities outside campus; or (c) other legitimate and permissible reasons. Make up examinations are administered and scheduled by the lecturer in agreement with the student. Assessment is carried out objectively and transparently, and in accordance with the regulation and procedures, and the results are informed to the students. Results are announced to provide feedback to the students on what they have done and achieved and to encourage those who have not made optimal efforts to improve themselves and obtain the better results in the future.\n\nStudents who have not met the course passing criteria will receive a short-term treatment of remedial teaching and their have their semester learning plan (RPS) evaluated learning process improvement. Students who get an E (fail) in a course must sign up for the course again in the following semester. The grade to be assigned to the students is the final grade they will receive in the current semester. This is stated in the 2020 UPI Education Implementation Guidelines.\n\nThe Internship Program(PPL) is a field activity for non-education sciencestudents. It is carried out in collaboration with public and private external institutions. Students of Mathematics Study Program who take part in the Internship Program(PPL) are guided by two lecturers from the Study Program and a person from the company where the students have their Internship Program(PPL). Internship in the Computer Science Study Program students taking the Internship Program (PPL) is supervised by a lecturer from the Study Program and a person from the company where the Internship Program(PPL) is attended.\n\nPassing and final grade of the Internship Program (PPL) is determined based on the accumulated score obtained from the supervisor, from the institution/company where the student is apprenticing, and from the supervising lecturer according to the formula stated in the PPL guidebook.\n\nIn addition to the Internship Program (PPL), the students also learn about the wider community environment through the Student Community Service (KKN) whose implementation is coordinated by the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM). The students can download information related to the Student Community Service (KKN) on the http://kkn.lppm.upi.edu/ page.\n\nIn the Student Community Service (KKN) students groups from various disciplinary backgrounds stay for a certain period of time in a community and participate actively in the life of the community. The group is guided by a supervising lecturer who serves as a companion and assessor for the student field activities. Before the Student Community Service (KKN) activities began, the lecturers and students would respectively be given briefing by the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM). Briefing for the supervisors relates to monitoring activities and information about the Student Community Service (KKN) assessments. Briefing for the students relates to the technical implementation of the Student Community Service (KKN) on the ground and the best practices. The supervising lecturer is responsible for monitoring activities. The assessment of the Student Community Service (KKN) participants is conducted on two aspects, namely the individual aspect and the group aspect. The supervising lecturer reports the KKN students score to the UPI Research and Community Service Institute (LPPM) for further entry into the system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UPI made some adjustment to the theme to allow participants (students) to continue to participate in activities risking their health and safety.\n\nThere are two tracks for completion of undergraduate (S1) study, namely the thesis track and the non-thesis track. The non-thesis track is for students who have a GPA (IPK) of 2.00 - 2.50. They are required to take 6 credits (SKS) of courses and make a thesis substitute paper. The study program makes regulations and SOPs for completion of study without a thesis track. The thesis track can be taken by students who have passed the thesis prerequisite courses, obtaining a minimum 105 credits (SKS) and GPA (IPK) of at least 2.50, and have received recommendation from the academic supervisor lecturer.\n\nThe procedures for thesis writing are as follows: thesis coordinator assigns supervisors I and II to the students; the students are guided in writing a thesis proposal; students take the thesis proposal examination. If the proposal approved by the examiners, students can continue the guidance process with the two supervisors, such as conducting activities to develop the instruments and collect data; proceed with writing the report of the data collection results, discussion, and conclusion. If the thesis writing results are considered appropriate by the supervisors, the student can take the thesis defense.\n\nThe proposal writing and examination exam follows the SOP; the procedure for the thesis defense follows the SOP. The final score of the thesis includes the assessment of thesis writing and thesis defense examination. A student is said to have passed the thesis examination if his final-thesis score is at least 2.0 (on the scale of 4). The thesis research is carried out independently under the guidance of the two thesis supervisors. In general, the procedure for final completion of the study through the thesis track is presented in the following flowchart below. The assessment system in four study programs includes student learning processes and outcomes. This system includesformative and summativeassessments.Formative assessment aims to obtain information that can be used to improve the learning process (program delivery), while summative assessment is used to assess the achievement of student learning outcomes (learning outcomes). The assessment guidelines generally follow the UPI Education Implementation Guidelines which can be accessed at https://dit-akademik.upi.edu/. Principle of Benchmarking Assessment (PAP) is used to assess student’s performance in a course. With PAP student achievement of a goal/competency is assessed against predetermined criteria . The final grade of a course is the cumulative result of the components of the assignment, mid-semester exams, final-semester exams, and other assessment components. In practice, each course has its own assessment procedures and techniques appropriate to its characteristics as long as it is not in conflict with the provisions of UPI Education Implementation Guidelines. This practical assessment guideline is contained in the course syllabus/RPS developed by a lecturer. In general, each subject uses integrative assessment techniques, namely between the process and the results, and between other assessment components: attendance, quizzes, mid-semester exams (UTS), final-semester exams (UAS), assignments, practicum (if any), participation, and presentation (if any). The percentage of the assessment components include the element of attendance (5%); participation/quizzes/assignments/presentations (15%); practicum (10%); mid-semester exam (35%); and final-semester exams (35%). Table below is the illustrates guidelines for determining grades for each course. In compulsory courses, the minimum passing grade is C, while for elective courses the minimum passing grade is D. Students who get an E (fail), should retake the class in the following year in order to get the appropriate grade with pass criteria. Students cannot cancel the grades of courses that they have passed, unless the they transfer to a different department/study program, where they have to cancel the expertise courses of the previous study program, or in the case where a student sign up for more than the maximum study load specified in the curriculum structure. The achievement of the course learning outcome (CLO) can be seen from the student learning outcomes in these courses which are measured using summative test instruments. Each test instrument consists of a number of questions, each of which measures the CLO in that course. Each question that will be used for the exam is validated first by the head of the KBK where the subject is located. Parallel course (the same course taught in different classes) must use the same questions and assessment criteria. The final course outcomes are then evaluated by the GKM team to ensure the achievement of PLOs related to these courses. The results of the assessment in the form of the final grade must be inputted by the lecturer of the course into the lecturer score input system through the website https://siak.upi.edu/sinndo. If the lecturer is late in inputting the grades, the lecturer in question will receive a warning and consequences. Students can view the final grade information for the courses they contact through the website https://student.upi.edu. Lecturers are obliged to design, manage, provide assignments/exams, provide feedback, and maintain student academic documents in an orderly manner. Relevant tothis obligation, students have the right to obtain clear and transparent information about their study results in the form of test scores, quizzes, assignments or projects, practicum, and/or presentations. Students who have questions about their grades can directly contact the lecturer to discuss the problem. If there is an error in the process of inputting the grades, the lecturer can correct the grade to match the facts as long as it is still within the period of grade entry. If input error is detected after the grade entry period is over, the lecturer can submit a request letter to the UPI Academic Directorate to correct the grade. The relationship between the learning outcome, the learning strategy, and the assessment used to measure the learning outcome in Computer Science study program will be presented below. Table below, illustrates the relationship between PLO, learning strategies and assessment in Computer Science Study Program.",
