Moreover, with the use of information and communication technology tools, which make it possible to carry out learning and teaching activities more effectively through information technology-based learning models or electronic learning, it is now increasingly recognized as a way to overcome educational problems, both in developed and developing countries. in developing countries. The integration of ICT into the learning process is needed to develop students' higher order thinking skills, develop skills in the field of ICT (ICT Literacy), and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and attractiveness of the learning process. Information and Communication Technology systems provide a broad, fast, effective, and efficient reach for the dissemination of information to various parts of the world. Information technology develops in line with the development of theory and communication and technology that supports the practice of learning activities. Computer-based learning, Web-based learning (e-learning), Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), AVA-based learning are forms of utilizing educational technology that need to be developed in today's world of education. Learning activities are the most basic activities in the whole educational process. This means that the achievement of educational goals depends a lot on how the learning process is designed and carried out professionally.",

Many educational policies have been issued which aim to facilitate and facilitate education providers and the community to be able to develop innovative education to achieve national education goals. The goals of national education are formulated through a policy called education policy. Education policy in Indonesia has undergone several changes with the aim of producing a national education system that characterizes the Indonesian nation. In 2003, Law No. 20 of 2003 was enacted regarding the national education system. The issuance of the law indicates that the Indonesian government is serious in achieving educational goals through an education policy.",
