  "Curriculum_Development_Study": "The industrial revolution 4.0 brought many changes, especially in the industrial sector involving digitalization from all walks of life. This began with the use of the internet that connected various tools, which became known as the Internet of Things. So, each of these tools can communicate, exchange data, and with programmed artificial intelligence methods, the tool can finally make decisions based on the input data received from various available sensors. Computer programs embedded in tools can involve various concepts and technologies in artificial intelligence, including Machine Learning. With this machine learning, the algorithm has the ability to learn automatically from the incoming training data. This computing process can also involve Cloud Computing technology, so that the data and knowledge used can be stored on the internet network provided by the Cloud Computing vendor. That way, various reliable and safe services can be obtained and used at any time and place.\n\nThe industrial revolution 4.0 cannot be utilized by the Indonesian people without education that is able to adopt and rely on progress and changes in this revolution. To achieve this, education must have learning methods, curricula, and other tools that: (i) support the improvement of critical thinking skills, (ii) have creativity and innovative abilities, (iii) have good communication skills and abilities, (iv) have the ability to cooperate and work in teams, and (v) have high flexibility and adaptability to be able to keep up with rapid technological developments. This is in line with various current educational concepts, which are better known as “Education for the 21st Century” (or education for the 21st century). This education is simply a learning that provides 21st century skills to students to be able to communicate, collaborate, think critically and solve problems, be creative and innovative, and master information technology. For this reason, the application of a scientific approach is needed to achieve the target of this student's ability.\n\nOn the other hand, with the development of technology and the need for the abilities of students in the 21st century, teachers/teachers also need to prepare themselves so that they are able to meet various competency requirements to carry out their duties and authorities professionally in accordance with existing demands and regulations. Various opinions explain that the challenges of teachers in the 21st century are not simple, namely:\n1. Teaching in multicultural society: Teachers need to be able to teach in a society that has cultural and linguistic differences.\n2. Teaching for the construction of meaning: Teachers must have the ability to construct a concept.\n3. Teaching for active learning: Teachers can apply active learning methods for their students.\n4. Teaching with technology: Teachers are able to involve the latest technology in their teaching.\n5. Teaching that focuses on carácter building: Teachers do not teach knowledge, but are also tasked with building good character for their students.\n6. Teaching for the hard and soft skills: Teachers are tasked with building skills in terms of knowledge, creativity, communication, and solving a problem to improve student competitiveness.\n\nWith the many challenges that must be faced by a teacher, the education of a teacher also needs to be improved both in terms of quality and level.\n\nTherefore, in line with the changing phenomena and challenges that have been described previously, the Department of Computer Science Education responded by opening a Masters Program in Computer Science Education. This study program is designed in 38 credits which contains teaching and strengthening materials in the fields of education, computer network technology, multimedia technology, software engineering, and other capabilities that are in line with current trends (among others artificial intelligence/machine learning, digital pedagogy, data analysis, internet of things, etc.). So, briefly, this master's study program is expected to be able to provide solutions to the challenges that must be faced by teachers, especially teachers in the field of computer science.",

  "Learning_Process": "The learning process is designed so that it has the characteristics, planning and implementation of a good learning process and has a well-distributed learning load. The characteristics of the learning process are interactive, holistic, integrative, scientific, contextual, thematic, effective, collaborative, and student-centered. The characteristics of this process are outlined in learning outcomes that reflect the learning process that encourages the formation of a comprehensive and broad mindset by internalizing local and national excellence and wisdom. The existence of linkages between learning outcomes with each other requires the learning process to be developed thematically, integratively, collaboratively, and contextually in accordance with the demands of the ability to solve problems in the scientific realm of computer science education, with a scientific approach so as to create an academic atmosphere that forms values in accordance with the norms, religion and national ethics. The learning process can be carried out in various forms such as lectures, responses, tutorials, seminars, practicums, field practices, and or through school field introduction programs. Learning methods adapt to developments and needs through interactions between lecturers, students and learning resources in schools, industry and other environments that are considered effective in achieving learning outcomes.",
  "Assessment": "Assessment using a standard bias as guidance in assessing the learning process and results in order to achieve the learning outcomes. The principle of assessment refers to learning assessment standards which include educative, authentic, objective, accountable, and transparent principles which are carried out in an integrated manner. The assessment techniques used include written tests, practical tests as well as performance and/or products as student work in the form of comprehensive assignments. Attitude assessment is carried out throughout learning through moral messages and directions related to learning activities, either directly or indirectly and set forth in the appropriate rubric form, while for the assessment of knowledge and skills using one or a combination of the assessment techniques that have been mentioned.\n\nThe end result of learning is the integration of established assessment techniques and instruments by upholding the principle of transparency. The mechanism for implementing the assessment is carried out starting from the preparation, implementation, providing feedback, as well as publication and documentation in accordance with the schedule set by the university. Furthermore, the assessment of learning achievement every semester is poured with a semester achievement index.",
